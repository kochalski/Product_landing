                        <p>The new KTM 350 SX-F continues to deliver a dominant mix of horsepower and agility. For 2019, it has gained even more performance and torque, bringing it ever closer to the power of a 450, without losing its 250-like agility. When you're looking for more than one advantage, this powerful, lightweight racer combines all your needs into one dominant package with serious championship pedigree to back it up.</p>

                        <p>Neatly arranged in a compact and light (26.6kg) construction, the engine of the 2019 KTM 350 SX-F features many new enhancements. A new clutch, improved transmission and a redesigned, lighter DOHC (double overheard camshaft) cylinder head, all contribute to making it stronger than ever before. Fitted with the latest electronic fuel injection system and a useful electric starter, just one push of a button fires up this impressively smooth and competitive engine.</p>

                        <h2>CHASSIS</h2>
                        <p>The KTM 350 SX provides an unrivalled combination of agility and power. The chassis on this model plays an integral role in its renowned maneuverability and also provides accurate feedback between track and rider. For 2019, a new lightweight, high-tech steel frame was developed and has been optimized for more accurate rider feedback. Its refined flex characteristics ensure the bike soaks up those big hits while still delivering excellent agility and high-speed stability. The chassis also features additional innovative elements, like "no dirt" footpegs and new brackets for mounting an optional composite skid plate. Overall, every element of the chassis contributes to an intuitive, high performance ride like no other.</p>
